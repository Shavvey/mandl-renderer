# Mandelbrot Renderer

![example image](./images/example2.png)

# Description

An attempt to render the Mandelbrot set, just using SDL and the beautifully dangerous C programming language.

# Building the Project

All that is required is `sdl` and `make` to compile the project.
The build process is pretty simple.

```sh
# use make to compile project
> make
# run the final executable
> ./mandl
```
